"""
-> Tuple Methods:   Python has two built-in methods that we can use in tuple.
    
    ->  count():    Returns the no of times a specified value occurs in a tuple.
            E.g:    marks = (50, 60, 50, 70, 80)
                    print(marks.count(50)) => 2

    ->  index():    Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position where it's found.
            E.g:    marks = (50, 60, 50, 70, 80)
                    print(marks.index(60)) => 1

-> Advantages of Tuple:
        ->  It's faster than lists.
        ->  It's immutable (changeable), so they can be used as keys in dictionaries.
        ->  It can be used as read only data.

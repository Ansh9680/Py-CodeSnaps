"""
->  Creating tuple with one element:To create a tuple with only one element,
                we must add a comma after the element.
            E.g:    marks = (79,)
                print(type(marks)) => <class 'tuple'>
        ->  Without comma, python will not recognise it as a tuple.
            E.g:    marks = (79)
                    print(type(marks)) => <class 'int'>

->  Mystery for you all that i'll reveal tomorrow & explain it in detail:
        secret_message = "fwoWlElToYwR WtQhDiAsC hpGaUgieL"

        output = secret_message[::2]

        print(output)

"""

Input function: It's a function that takes input from the user during the execution of the program.
    Syntax: input(prompt) -> prompt is optional

Type Conversion: Input function always returns a string and takes input in string,
    so we've to do type conversion if we wanna perform addition or subtraction.
    Example:
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        email = input("Enter your email id: ")
        print(f"Thanks {name}, we've sent an email to {email}")

    f => f-string it's used to access & print values of any variable.

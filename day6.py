-> Collection of data types:
                -> List
                -> Tuple
                -> Set
                -> Dictionary
    -> List: It's a collection of multiple items that's stored in a single list.
            -> Syntax: my_list = [10, 20, 30, "apple", True]
            -> Key-points: Ordered, Mutable, Allows duplication of values.
    -> Tuple: It's same as list, but in tuple we can't change values.
            -> Syntax: my_tuple = (10, 20, "banana", False)
            -> Key-points: Ordered, immutable, Duplication of values allowed. 
    -> Set: It's an unordered collection of values in which duplicate values are automatically removed.
            -> Syntax: my_set = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2}
            -> Key-points: unordered, duplication of values not allowed, mutable.
    -> Dictionary: It's a key-value pair list. Every key has its unique value.
            -> Syntax: my_dict = {"name":"xyz", "age":123}
            -> Key-points: Ordered, keys-unique, values-duplication allowed, mutable.

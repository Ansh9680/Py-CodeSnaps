"""
-> bool type: It represents true or false values.
        True : yes, correct or 1
        False: no, wrong or 0
    Example:    x = True
                y = False
                print(x) => True
                print(type(x)) => <class 'bool'>

-> Values that are false in python:
        0, 0.0, "", '', [], {}, (), None

-> These are used when:
    -> When function doesn't returns anything.
    -> We want to define a variable but assign a value later.
    -> To represent absence of a value.
